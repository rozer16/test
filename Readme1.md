1. Leadership Principle: We Take Ownership

What:

•	Took the initiative to challenge the status quo by refining processes for regulatory reporting (e.g., EMIR Refit, EMIR Valuation Reporting) and handling production issues with quick turnaround solutions, such as 
	•	JSCC FTP Production connection for non-TLS connection (C167042-10261)
	•	Correct (db patch) Reporting obligation of 85 Citigate trades (C167042C-3358)
	•	Eurex/LCH UTI issue since OasysDB writing old UTI – FCA EMIR inquiry (C167042C-4257)
	•	[EMIR ESMA PROD Request] Update UTI for EUREX trades (C167042C-5307)
	•	[ESMA PROD Request] Correct (db patch) Reporting obligation of 4 Citigate trades (C167042C-5710)

•	Led and coordinated the production release processes, ensuring smooth transitions by mentoring new team members on release paperwork and procedures.

How:

•Encouraged a culture of accountability by taking proactive steps in problem identification and remediation, Raising risk at right time and addressing them on timely manner such as addressing ISIN population issues.
•Actively engaged in agile ceremonies and retrospectives, fostering an environment of open communication and collective responsibility, raising blockers, and ensuring,alignment with goals.
•In case of any issue, irrespective of who is owner, provided support during development/production issues/releases

2. Leadership Principle: We Deliver with Pride

What:

	•	Driving Kafka migration, mentoring team members on best practices for topic creation, two-way authentication, and service testing.
	•	Ensured code quality by adhering to SDLC standards, maintaining high test coverage across regulatory components for new developed component, and proactively identifying functional and technical gaps in applications.
	•	Delivered high-quality production support by addressing issues like JSCC FTP connection and FCA EMIR inquiries.

How:

	•	Focused on operational excellence by optimizing workflows for both development and testing, continuously improving quality and reducing risks associated with technical debt.
	•	Demonstrated a commitment to long-term value by actively resolving root causes in application hygiene and regulatory reporting, with consistent follow-up on identified vulnerabilities and gaps.

3. Leadership Principle: We Succeed Together

What:

	•	Provided cross-team support, particularly to the Hermes (and now Prometheus teams) through onboarding assistance, knowledge sharing, and detailed walkthroughs of Citigate and DCS application flows.
	•	Led sessions to explain complex infrastructure details and reference data flow, enhancing collaboration and collective ownership of the application architecture.
 	• Helped Keerthana and Akash to understand respective flow and complete phase 1 & phase 2 kafka migration.

How:

	•	Cultivated a team ethos of shared success by mentoring new team members and guiding them through the Kafka migration and production release processes.
	•	Demonstrated servant leadership by enabling teams to be self-organizing and autonomous, providing them with the tools and knowledge needed to succeed, while still being available for guidance when required.

4. Risk and Control:

What:

	•	Ensured regulatory compliance and control by working closely with BAs, POs, to enhance application hygiene, particularly in EMIR Refit projects.
	•	Resolved production issues promptly, minimizing impact on business deliverables and ensuring client expectations were met.

How:

	•	Proactively managed risk by integrating security controls into the codebase, ensuring adherence to Citi’s control framework, and enforcing 80%+ test coverage to avoid post-deployment risks.
	•	Facilitated seamless handovers to support teams through thorough documentation and knowledge transfer sessions, reducing potential risks in production environments.

5. Client & Franchise Outcomes:

What:

	•	Led significant components of NEO, including designing Fenix feed processors and contributing to catalyst component analysis.
	•	Actively participated in and contributed to improving the overall delivery of the OTC area through collaboration with multiple teams, enhancing communication and productivity.

How:

	•	Embraced the Agile journey by focusing on continuous improvement, suggesting enhancements during retrospectives, and addressing functional gaps that improved the performance and usability of the applications.
	•	Engaged with stakeholders and ensured that the solutions provided met business needs, with minimal friction during implementation, leading to improved client and operational outcomes.

This framework integrates your key accomplishments with the leadership principles, clearly highlighting both “what” you achieved and “how” you approached your work.

As a Senior Java Developer at Citibank, I am responsible for designing, developing, and optimizing high-performance applications that support critical business processes in the investment banking domain. My role involves end-to-end software development, from gathering requirements and system design to coding, testing, and deployment.

With over 11 years of experience, I am deeply involved in ensuring the scalability, security, and performance of the systems I work on. I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, including business analysts, architects, and other developers, to deliver solutions that align with business objectives. Additionally, I mentor junior developers, contribute to code reviews, and drive best practices in coding and software architecture within the team.

I focus on improving system efficiency, solving complex problems, and constantly updating my knowledge to implement modern technologies and methodologies in our projects. This role not only demands technical expertise but also strong problem-solving, communication, and leadership skills, which I actively demonstrate in my daily responsibilities.

I would like to strengthen my engineering excellence in building highly scalable, resilient microservices and modern cloud-native solutions
in order to drive higher quality, faster delivery, and improved system reliability across critical financial platforms
so that I can contribute more effectively to Citi’s strategic modernization initiatives and mentor teams on engineering best practices
which will positively impact me by accelerating my growth toward a senior technical leadership role and increasing my overall architectural influence.

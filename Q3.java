Since joining the team as Vice President two months ago, my primary focus has been on understanding the business domain, existing systems, and team dynamics to contribute effectively. While I am still ramping up, I am trying to take active ownership of the PSE for CMP project, working closely with a team of 7 developers.

In this short span:
	•	I have engaged in planning and technical discussions to align development efforts with business goals.
	•	I’ve been taking the opportunity to work with the production support team to help resolve issues, which has helped me better understand real-time system behavior and critical flows.
	•	I’ve also started interacting with Business Analysts to deepen my understanding of the system and its functional goals.
	•	I am trying my best to collaborate with Production Developers like Jocelyn and David to gain more insight into the business logic and decision-making processes.
	•	I’ve been helping the team by unblocking tasks where possible and contributing ideas for improvement, especially around the Sales Credit Request workflow.

I remain committed to contributing meaningfully to our key goals and look forward to accelerating my impact in the second half of the year.

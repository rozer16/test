Since joining the team around two months ago, my primary focus has been on understanding the business domain, system architecture, and team dynamics to contribute effectively. While I am still in the process of ramping up, I am trying to take active ownership of the PSE for CMP project, working closely with the team.

In this short span:
	•	I’ve been focusing on ensuring our deliverables align with engineering excellence standards, including maintaining clean, testable code, enabling Sonar gates, and keeping them consistently green.
	•	I am actively involved in PSE for CMP – Phase 1 (Post-Trade), which is nearing completion. We are preparing to begin the Pre-Trade phase shortly.
	•	I’ve taken the opportunity to work closely with the production support team on issues like mailbox size limitations, investigating stuck workflows, analyzing the root cause, and learning how to use APIs to force-complete such workflows when needed.
	•	I’ve started interacting with Business Analysts to enhance my understanding of the system and how the business functions.
	•	I’m taking opportunities to work closely with the production development team (Jocelyn, David) to gain deeper insight into the domain and understand the end-to-end flow better.
	•	I’ve also started exploring aspects of First Line of Defense (1LoD) responsibilities to understand control processes and risk mitigation measures.

Alongside my technical responsibilities, I am also focusing on developing leadership skills, including supporting the team, improving communication across stakeholders, and understanding broader team objectives and alignment. I am also planning to nominate myself for the E3 Engineering Excellence program to further this journey.

While it’s still early in my journey with the team, I am committed to continuously learning, contributing to key initiatives, and building toward stronger impact in the second half of the year.

I truly appreciate your constant support, guidance, and encouragement over the past few months. Thank you for trusting me with new responsibilities and for always being approachable and inspiring.

I look forward to continuing this journey, learning, and taking on more opportunities to make a meaningful impact.

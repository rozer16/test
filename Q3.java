Since joining the team as Vice President two months ago, my primary focus has been on understanding the business domain, system architecture, and team dynamics to contribute effectively. While I am still in the process of ramping up, I am trying to take active ownership of the PSE for CMP project, working closely with a team of 7 developers.

In this short span:
	•	I’ve been focusing on ensuring our deliverables align with engineering excellence standards, including maintaining clean, testable code, enabling Sonar gates, and keeping them consistently green.
	•	I am actively involved in PSE for CMP – Phase 1 (Post-Trade), which is nearing completion. We are preparing to begin the Pre-Trade phase shortly.
	•	I have taken the opportunity to work closely with the production support team on issues such as mailbox size limitations, investigating stuck workflows, analyzing the root cause, and learning about the APIs used to force-complete such workflows when needed.
	•	I’ve been interacting with Business Analysts to strengthen my understanding of the system and how the business functions.
	•	I am working closely with production developers (Jocelyn, David) to gain deeper insight into the domain and the end-to-end flow.
	•	I have also started exploring aspects of First Line of Defense (1LoD) responsibilities to understand control processes and risk mitigation measures.

Alongside my technical responsibilities, I am also trying to develop leadership skills, including supporting the team, improving communication across stakeholders, and understanding broader team objectives and alignment.

While it’s still early in my journey with the team, I am committed to continuously learning, contributing to key initiatives, and building toward stronger impact in the second half of the year.
